# Object-Oriented Programming Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects, assignments, and class materials from my Object-Oriented Programming coursework at Ariel University.

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods). This repository demonstrates OOP principles and best practices through various implementations and projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by projects and assignments:

- **Ex0-Java**: Introduction to Java and OOP basics
- **Ex1-Java**: More advanced OOP concepts in Java
- **Ex2-Java**: Data structures and algorithms with OOP
- **Ex3-Python**: OOP principles implemented in Python
- **Utilities**: Common classes and utilities used across projects
- **Design Patterns**: Implementations of various design patterns

## Key Topics Covered

- **OOP Core Concepts**:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction

- **Design Principles**:
  - SOLID Principles
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- **Design Patterns**:
  - Creational Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Builder)
  - Structural Patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Composite)
  - Behavioral Patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)

- **Advanced OOP Concepts**:
  - Generic Programming
  - Reflection
  - Event-Driven Programming
  - Unit Testing in OOP

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Primary programming language for OOP implementation
- **Python**: For exploring OOP in a dynamically typed language
- **JUnit**: For unit testing
- **UML**: For system design and class diagrams
- **Git**: For version control
- **Maven/Gradle**: For dependency management and build automation
- **JavaFX**: For GUI applications (where applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Python 3.x (for Python assignments)
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or similar)
- Maven or Gradle (depending on the project)

### Building the Projects

Most Java projects can be built using Maven:

```bash
# Navigate to a specific project
cd Object_Oriented_Programming/Ex1-Java

# Build the project
mvn clean install

# Run the tests
mvn test
```

For Python projects:

```bash
# Navigate to the Python project directory
cd Object_Oriented_Programming/Ex3-Python

# Run the Python script
python main.py
```

## Example Projects

### Data Structures Implementation

Object-oriented implementations of various data structures:
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

### Library Management System

A complete library management system that demonstrates:
- Class hierarchy and inheritance
- Interface implementation
- Database integration
- GUI using JavaFX

### Game Development

A small game that showcases:
- Game objects and inheritance
- Event-driven programming
- Design patterns in action
- Graphics and animation

## UML Diagrams

The repository includes UML diagrams for major projects:
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- State diagrams
